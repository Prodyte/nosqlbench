/**

 * for use with higher-order functions, when they require a
 * LongUnaryOperator as an argument. Some of the higher-order functions within
 * this library specifically require a LongUnaryOperator as an argument, while

 * forms with compatible types which can't be converted directly or
 * automatically by Java.
 *
 * In such cases, those types of functions can be wrapped with the forms
 * described here in order to allow the inner and outer functions to work together.
