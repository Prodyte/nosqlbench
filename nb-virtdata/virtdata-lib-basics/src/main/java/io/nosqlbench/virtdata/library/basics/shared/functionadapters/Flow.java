/**
 * <p>Combine functions into one.</p>
 *
 * <p>This function allows you to combine multiple other functions into one. This is often useful
 * for constructing more sophisticated recipes, when you don't have the ability to use
 * control flow or non-functional forms.</p>
 *
 * <p>The functions will be stitched together using the same logic that VirtData uses when
 * combining flows outside functions. That said, if the functions selected are not the right ones,
 * then it is possible to end up with the wrong data type at the end. To remedy this, be sure
 * to add input and output qualifiers, like <code>long-&gt;</code> or <code>-&gt;String</code> where
 * appropriate, to ensure that VirtData selects the right functions within the flow.</p>
