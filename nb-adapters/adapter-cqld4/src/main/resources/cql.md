# cql

In this version of NoSQLBench, the CQL driver is fully
based on version 4 of the
[Java Driver for Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-java-driver)
version 4.X.

This `cqld4` driver has replaced the older CQL driver under the name `cql`.
Previous versions of the CQL drivers are no longer bundled with NB5. Instead,
when you specify either `cql` or `cqld4`, the version 4 drivers is used.

See the help for `cqld4` for more details.
